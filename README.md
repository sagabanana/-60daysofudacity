5. Listened to Steve Jobs's commencement speech at Standford 2005
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=161&v=UF8uR6Z6KLc
Highlights:  "Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. [...] No one wants to die. ... And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.  Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.

Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-16/google-protest-leader-meredith-whittaker-is-leaving-the-company
Highlights:  "Google, in the conventional pursuit of quarterly earnings, is gaining significant and largely unchecked power to impact our world (including in profoundly dangerous ways, such as accelerating the extraction of fossil fuels and the deployment of surveillance technology)," she wrote in a blog on Tuesday. "How this vast power is used — who benefits and who bears the risk — is one of the most urgent social and political (and yes, technical) questions of our time." [...] "People in the AI field who know the limitations of this tech, and the shaky foundation on which these grand claims are perched, need to speak up, loudly. The consequences of this kind of BS marketing are deadly (if profitable for a few)," Whittaker wrote on Twitter on Sunday."

I am sharing a powerful quote by Thich Nhat Hanh as we are learning Deep Learning and beyond as a collective community.

"I am inviting you to go deeper, to learn and to practice so that you become someone who has great capacity for being solid, calm and without fear, because our society needs people like you who have these qualities, and your children, our children, need people like you, in order to go on, in order to become solid, and calm and, without fear."

Day 30:
1.  Corresponded on Slack
2.  Prepared for PyTorch Summer Hackathon:  https://www.eventbrite.com/e/pytorch-summer-hackathon-in-menlo-park-registration-63756668913
3.  Read:  https://www.forbes.com/sites/thomasbrewster/2019/07/24/meet-the-face-behind-faceapp-rich-russian-yaroslav-goncharov/?fbclid=IwAR1EiP27Po0EIPigHKMYsznxcIYuZryk1vgGBnxfFPGt4MYcW4U73v9IOx4#401cb9ed255a
Highlights and my thoughts:  "Goncharov said those terms were so broad because he had planned earlier to turn FaceApp into a "social network for faces." "To do this kind of product, our privacy policy had to be very similar to what Instagram had. Our current privacy policy is very similar to what Instagram has ... but nobody blames Instagram, because it's Instagram," he adds."  and the public wasn't aware of it nor the mainstream media didn't cover this privacy policy.  This likely happened because he is Russian, to serve as propaganda, to heighten public awareness along with politics -- he is getting attention."
4.  Read:  https://venturebeat.com/2019/07/25/standard-cognition-series-b-funding/?fbclid=IwAR07gBF8eMu3lKnOhvr_F29M1mNSvUTdNkHgEWr0lM1iu3XGuFmhtl_onP0
Highlights:  "A checkout-free future might be closer than you think, thanks to startups like Standard Cognition. The San Francisco-based company, whose patented platform uses cameras and algorithms to keep tabs on customers as they peruse store shelves, nabbed $40 million in series A funding last November and a partnership with Paltac in Japan that will see its autonomous checkout solution deployed in 3,000 stores. On the heels of this success, it’s secured $35 million in a series B round led by the EQT Ventures fund, with participation from existing investors Initialized Capital, CRV, and Y Combinator."
5.  Exercise:  No exercise instead I used the time to do my laundry and helped others.  
I want to express my deep gratitude, :thanks: "Thank you!!!" :thank-you: and :tada: I celebrate you!! :ddance: have a lovely and restful weekend!!! @annaSWE @Helena Barmer @Yemi @Erika Yoon @Shashi Gharti @Ayesha Manzur @Maria @Evi @Eileen @Stark @Berenice @nabhanpv @Sourav @AbdElrhman @Temitope Oladokun @susyjam @Ellyana Linden @Frida @Nora @Elena Kutanov @Jess @Samuela Anastasi @Tesin Dosch @Khush @Sankalp Dayal @Oudarjya Sen Sarma

2.  Attended today's #sg_wonder-vision meetup with @Helena Barmer @Shashank Jain @Sreekanth Zipsy @Abhishek Tandon @Deasy Indrawati  @Anshu Trivedi @Seeratpal K. Jaura @Pooja Vinod @Joyce Obi @James Korge @Arunn @Jess @Vamsi @nabhanpv
@Droid @Sourav @Shashi Gharti then divided into a smaller group, Face Detection Group with @Seeratpal K. Jaura @Vamsi @Joyce Obi
@Sourav @James Korge @Rupesh Purum @Anshu Trivedi @Md. Mahedi Hasan Riday and we discussed:
-> Dataset to work on
-> create a git repo so that everyone can find the links easily and contribute
-> discuss preprocessing and postprocessing
All these ideas will be discussed in detail in next meetup along with:
-> discuss architecture and model
-> dataset to work on

4.  Exercise:  No exercise but instead I read some nice words during the day.  And one of them I will share here:  

“It may well seem to you that the sun is shining more brightly and that everything has taken on a new charm. That, at any rate, is the inevitable consequence of true love, I believe, and it is a wonderful thing. And I also believe that those who hold that no one thinks clearly when in love are wrong, for it is at just that time that one thinks very clearly indeed and is more energetic than one was before. And love is something eternal, it may change in aspect but not in essence. And there is the same difference between someone who is in love and what he was like before as there is between a lamp that is lit and one that is not. The lamp was there all the time and it was a good lamp, but now it is giving light as well and that is its true function. And one has more peace of mind about many things and so is more likely to do better work.”
–– Vincent van Gogh (Source: Letter to Theo van Gogh, The Hague, 21-28 March 1883) 

Sending Van Gogh's reflections to everyone everywhere!!

4.  Had :torch_heart_love:PyTorch Summer Hackathon:torch_heart_love: prep virtual meeting with @annaSWE @Yu Sun and @Anju Mercian and learned something valuable -- "sarcasm can hurt people's feeling".  What we consider as clever and funny could have a painful effect on some people and we want to be considerate of others -- we don't want to hurt other people's feeling.  Another one is there's no such thing as superior or inferior among people but everyone has their own talents and gifts and bring them to the table to share, to strengthen and to harmonize the entire picture.  We need each other.  We complement each other.  We must remember this and be the light of what we know.  Thanks @annaSWE for reminding us!! :thanks::beatingheart:

Sending warm thoughts with Mary Oliver's words for all beings everywhere:  

“Things take the time they take.
Don't worry.
How many roads did St. Augustine follow before he became St. Augustine?”

2. Wow! our team, MineTorch won 3rd place #Pytorchsummerhackathon19, incredible joy, and celebration, :star-struck::heart_eyes::star2:bringing a couple of Oculus and more home hacking last 2 days, Facebook in Menlo Park, CA. It's been an incredible, unreal experience meeting, engaging and creating with the brightest minds:brain::grinning::heartpulse::nerd_face:; researchers, developers, founders -- the creator of PyTorch and the entire team, the people whom I watch, read, study and talk about from a distance that is a virtual distance, are actually real people with bodies and minds, of course, thoughts and feelings, smiles. My kiddo, E, "Thank you and love", came with me, sat and hacking next to me the first day. Unreal but real. Thanks everyone for all the support!
