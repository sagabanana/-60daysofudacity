5. Listened to Steve Jobs's commencement speech at Standford 2005
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=161&v=UF8uR6Z6KLc
Highlights:  "Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. [...] No one wants to die. ... And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.  Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.

Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking.

Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."

2.  Read Google Protest Leader Leaves, Warns of Company's Unchecked Power
https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-07-16/google-protest-leader-meredith-whittaker-is-leaving-the-company
Highlights:  "Google, in the conventional pursuit of quarterly earnings, is gaining significant and largely unchecked power to impact our world (including in profoundly dangerous ways, such as accelerating the extraction of fossil fuels and the deployment of surveillance technology)," she wrote in a blog on Tuesday. "How this vast power is used — who benefits and who bears the risk — is one of the most urgent social and political (and yes, technical) questions of our time." [...] "People in the AI field who know the limitations of this tech, and the shaky foundation on which these grand claims are perched, need to speak up, loudly. The consequences of this kind of BS marketing are deadly (if profitable for a few)," Whittaker wrote on Twitter on Sunday."
3.  Set up #sg_mom-is-wow 2nd virtual meeting

4.  Exercise:  I am out of town helping a family member and timely I was reminded to be solid, calm and without fear to take care all things well.

I am sharing a powerful quote by Thich Nhat Hanh as we are learning Deep Learning and beyond as a collective community.

"I am inviting you to go deeper, to learn and to practice so that you become someone who has great capacity for being solid, calm and without fear, because our society needs people like you who have these qualities, and your children, our children, need people like you, in order to go on, in order to become solid, and calm and, without fear."

Sending a "solid, calm and without fear presence" to @Helena Barmer @Stark @Berenice @Erika Yoon @Evi @annaSWE @Marianna Janczak @Maria @Tesin Dosch @Shashi Gharti @nabhanpv @Nora @Eileen @AbdElrhman @Ayesha Manzur and @Frida
