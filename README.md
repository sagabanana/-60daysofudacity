Day 8
Inquiring and answering; corresponding on Slack
Read an article from TechCrunch about design and learned that "Trends like programmatic or “AI” design that allow designers to define an algorithm and a set of constraints, and then generate “impossible” shapes out of edgy materials to obtain a result unable to be sketched or sculpted by traditional processes."
